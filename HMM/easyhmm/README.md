# Easy_HMM
A easy HMM program written with Python, including the full codes of training, prediction and decoding.

# Introduction
- Simple algorithms and models to learn HMMs in pure Python
- Including two HMM models: HMM with Gaussian emissions, and HMM with multinomial (discrete) emissions
- Using unnitest to verify our performance with [hmmlearn](http://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "hmmlearn") . 
- Three examples: Dice problem, Chinese words segmentation and stock analysis.
